Learn Python programming with [Djangogirls](https://djangogirls.org/) curriculum. Materials with autoupdate stored in single Docker image

Submitted as part of Docker Hack Day 2015 [https://blog.docker.com/2015/09/docker-global-hack-day-3-starts-today/](https://blog.docker.com/2015/09/docker-global-hack-day-3-starts-today/)

A big frustration for new students learning to code is getting their development environments setup. This hackathon project will seek to reduce that initial friction by creating an easy way to be up and running with a pre-configured environment.

In addition to learning about programming, frameworks and the web stack, students can learn about aspects of DevOps (virtualization tools like Docker) to round out their skills so we'll be looking to contribute docs to the Djangogirls on this in addition to building out the Docker containers/image.

The Djangogirls organization has been taking the Python, Django and learn to code communities by storm in the last year and a half. Chapters have been established in multiple countries and the workshops are very popular.
